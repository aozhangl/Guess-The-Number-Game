# Guess-The-Number-Game
This is a mini-project assignment that I did for the online course "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1)" by Rice University that can be found on the website Coursera.  
This program was written using CodeSkulptor, a website that runs Python programs, as suggested in the course, and may not work outside of CodeSkulptor. 
You can try out the program using the following link: http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user45_HKLwv3AWM9pIKwA.py
